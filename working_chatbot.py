**1. Memory Profiling**
- Use `memory_profiler`: `pip install memory-profiler`
- Add `@profile` decorator to functions
- Run: `python -m memory_profiler your_script.py`

**2. Code Optimizations**
- Replace lists with generators for large datasets
- Use `__slots__` in classes to reduce memory overhead
- Implement connection pooling for databases
- Clear large variables with `del variable_name`

**3. Architecture Changes**
- Implement caching with Redis/Memcached
- Use streaming for large file processing
- Consider microservices for heavy operations

**4. Monitoring**
- Set up memory alerts
- Track memory usage over time
- Profile production regularly

What's your current memory usage pattern? Are you processing large files or handling many concurrent requests?""",

**1. Database Layer**
- Add proper indexes to frequently queried columns
- Use connection pooling (SQLAlchemy, psycopg2-pool)
- Optimize queries (avoid N+1 problems)
- Consider read replicas for scaling

**2. Application Layer**
- Implement async/await for I/O operations
- Use caching (Redis) for expensive computations
- Optimize serialization (use orjson instead of json)
- Profile with cProfile to find bottlenecks

**3. Infrastructure**
- Use load balancers for horizontal scaling
- Implement CDN for static assets
- Set up proper monitoring (DataDog, New Relic)
- Consider containerization with Docker

**4. Code Optimizations**
- Use list comprehensions over loops
- Avoid global variables
- Implement proper error handling
- Use appropriate data structures

**1. Information Gathering**
- Collect error logs, stack traces, and system metrics
- Reproduce the issue in a controlled environment
- Document when the issue started and what changed

**2. Isolation Strategy**
- Use binary search to narrow down the problem
- Comment out code sections to isolate the issue
- Test with minimal data sets

**3. Debugging Tools**
- Use `pdb` for interactive debugging: `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()`
- Add strategic logging with different levels
- Use IDE debuggers for complex logic
- Implement health checks and monitoring

**4. Testing & Validation**
- Write unit tests to prevent regression
- Use integration tests for API endpoints
- Implement automated testing in CI/CD
